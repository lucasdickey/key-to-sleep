In the digital illustration, the square canvas is divided into two primary sections: the upper 1/3 dedicated to the text and the lower 2/3 featuring the main characters and setting.

The text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed in the upper portion of the image, rendered in the bold, all-caps Bebas Neue font. The letters are a warm, sandy beige, evoking the colors of the coastal landscape at twilight. The text is perfectly centered horizontally and has generous margins of at least 25% from the top, left, and right edges, ensuring a balanced and uncrowded appearance.

In the lower 2/3 of the image, eleven-year-old Oliver and his seagull companion, Sable, are the central focal points. Oliver stands barefoot on a sandy beach, wearing an APES ON KEYS hoodie. The hoodie is a soft, muted navy blue, complementing the calm colors of the evening sky. Oliver's expression is one of gentle curiosity, his deep blue eyes reflecting the hues of the sea. In his hand, he holds a journal, its pages fluttering slightly in the coastal breeze.

Beside him, Sable, the seagull, sits peacefully on the rim of a weathered wooden boat resting on the sand. The boat is depicted in soft, warm browns, with its wood grain visible, adding texture and a sense of history to the scene. The rim of the boat catches the silvery light of the moon, which casts a gentle glow across the sand, echoing the story's themes of resilience and quiet strength.

The background is a serene coastal landscape, with the ocean's waves gently lapping at the shore. The sky transitions from deep indigos to lighter twilight tones near the horizon, dotted with twinkling stars that add a dreamlike quality to the scene. The setting radiates peace and calm, inviting viewers into a world of quiet reflection and exploration.

The image employs a vintage book cover aesthetic, featuring bold outlines and a muted color palette dominated by sunset oranges, deep blues, and soft browns. A subtle grain texture overlays the entire illustration, providing a nostalgic feel reminiscent of mid-century children's books, enhancing the story's calming and introspective mood.
