In the illustration, the primary focus is on Amir and his falcon companion, Zari, set in the enchanting twilight of the desert. Positioned in the lower two-thirds of the image, Amir stands with a gentle, contemplative expression. He is wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, the fabric gently rustling in the desert breeze. His eyes, depicted as warm amber pools, reflect the dim glow of the setting sun, adding a serene and introspective aura to his presence.

Beside Amir, Zari the falcon is poised gracefully, her feathers shimmering like burnished copper against the muted sand backdrop. Her wings are partially spread, capturing the final light of the day and symbolizing the boundless spirit of their shared journey.

The desert around them is serene and vast, painted in hues of coral and deep gold as the sun dips below the horizon. Sparse silhouettes of distant cacti and gently undulating dunes add depth to the composition, creating a sense of infinite space and tranquility.

In the upper portion of the image, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed in bold Bebas Neue font. The text sits comfortably with at least a 25% margin from all edges, ensuring no part of any letter is cropped or extends beyond the boundaries. The letters are a soft cream color, harmonizing with the overall muted palette, and are perfectly centered horizontally, maintaining the visual balance of the illustration.

The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of mid-century children's book illustrations, with bold outlines and a flat design that evoke a vintage poster feel. The atmosphere is one of peaceful wonder, inviting the viewer to lose themselves in the quiet beauty of the desert night and the harmonious companionship of Amir and Zari. A subtle texture overlay adds a hint of nostalgia, enhancing the calming and dreamlike quality of the scene.
