The digital illustration depicts a serene desert scene under a vast evening sky. The main focus of the artwork is Samir, an eleven-year-old boy with a calm, thoughtful expression. He is depicted wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, its logo subtly visible on the chest. Beside him is his loyal companion, Nuri, a small fennec fox with large, expressive eyes and oversized ears that add character to his silhouette.

The duo is positioned centrally in the lower two-thirds of the image, adhering carefully to the composition guidelines. Samir is shown kneeling gently beside a blooming cactus, its delicate white flowers glowing softly in the twilight. His fingers lightly touch the petals, while his leather-bound notebook rests open on the sand beside him, filled with sketches of desert flora and notes of the day's journey.

The setting is a tranquil expanse of golden sand dunes, the soft hues of the sunset casting a warm glow across the landscape. Long shadows stretch gracefully, and the delicate scent of sage and distant rain seem almost tangible. The sky above transitions from warm sunset tones to a deepening blue, dotted with the first hints of starlight.

The upper part of the image, with ample breathing space, features the text "KEY TO SLEEP" prominently displayed in Bebas Neue font. The text is centered both horizontally and vertically within its allocated space, maintaining the critical requirement of at least 25% margins from all edges. The letters are bold and unmistakable, ensuring clarity and readability without overshadowing the serene scene below.

The overall color palette is composed of muted, warm tones – sunset oranges, deep blues, and soft browns – creating a vintage poster-like aesthetic. The illustration employs bold, confident line work, and a subtle grain overlay adds a vintage feel, aligning with the specified retro illustration style. The mood is peaceful and dreamlike, evoking feelings of comfort and sleepiness, perfectly capturing the essence of Samir and Nuri's gentle adventure across the desert.
