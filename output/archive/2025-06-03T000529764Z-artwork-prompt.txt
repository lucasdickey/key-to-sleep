In the lower two-thirds of the square digital illustration, Theo and Zuri are the central focal points. Theo, a young boy on the brink of eleven, stands with his meerkat friend Zuri by his side. He is wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie, which adds a modern touch to his otherwise timeless adventure. Theo's expression is serene and curious, capturing his contemplative nature as he stands amidst the golden grasses of the savanna. Zuri, with her sleek fur and bright eyes, is perched attentively next to him, embodying alertness and companionship.

The setting is the sprawling savanna at twilight, where the sky transitions from a warm orange to deep indigo, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The tall grasses sway gently, painted in hues of amber and gold, while distant acacia trees frame the scene with their iconic silhouettes. The glow of the setting sun casts long, soft shadows that dance across the ground, enhancing the scene's tranquility.

In the center of the image, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed in Bebas Neue font, all in capital letters. The text is positioned with extremely large margins, ensuring each letter is fully visible and well-integrated into the design. The text occupies approximately the center of the image, with generous padding on the left and right, maintaining at least 25% margin from all edges, allowing the scene to breathe without distraction.

The overall illustration embraces a vintage poster aesthetic, with bold, confident line work and a muted, warm color palette. The flat design and limited shading give it a retro children's book feel, complemented by a subtle grain overlay that adds a nostalgic texture. The composition balances negative space and illustrated elements, creating a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere that invites viewers to relax and drift into a serene slumber.
