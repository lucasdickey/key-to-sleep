The artwork is set against a serene desert landscape, captured in muted tones of warm sunset oranges and deep twilight blues. The main character, Amir, is placed prominently in the lower two-thirds of the image. Amir, a young boy of eleven, stands with a thoughtful expression, wearing a sand-colored "APES ON KEYS" hoodie. The hoodie’s texture is subtly defined, maintaining the vintage poster aesthetic with bold, confident lines and minimal shading. 

Beside Amir is Rafiki, his wise old owl companion. Rafiki's feathers glisten with a moonlit sand color, and his eyes reflect a quiet wisdom. The owl stands perched on a small dune next to Amir, its gaze directed at the sky, adding to the dreamlike quality of the scene.

In the background, the desert unfolds in gentle undulating dunes, bathed in the soft glow of a setting sun. The sky transitions from deep orange to the beginnings of a star-filled night, creating a peaceful, calming atmosphere. The stars begin to twinkle, offering a sense of vastness and connection to the universe.

Centered and occupying the upper third of the image, the text "KEY TO SLEEP" is prominently displayed. The text is in the Bebas Neue font, in all caps, ensuring it is bold and clear. It is perfectly centered with generous margins from all edges—at least 25% of the image width and height. The letters do not touch the boundaries, adhering strictly to the requirement for full visibility.

There is a retro illustration style reminiscent of mid-century children’s books, with a subtle grain overlay, giving it a vintage feel. The composition balances negative space with illustrated elements, creating a sense of calm and tranquility, which aligns with the story’s theme of quiet adventure and introspection.
