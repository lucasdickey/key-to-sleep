To create the artwork for the "Key to Sleep" episode titled "The Sleeping Sands," the illustration should capture the serene and mystical essence of Amir’s journey through the desert with his companion, Zephyr the fennec fox. Here's a visual concept based on the story and stylistic instructions:

- **Main Focus**: Amir and Zephyr.
  - **Amir**: A young boy with amber-colored eyes, wearing an "APES ON KEYS" hoodie. His expression is one of wonder and curiosity, as he gazes at the glowing fireflies.
  - **Zephyr**: The fennec fox, with its large ears perked up, reflecting the starlight, the silent yet attentive companion.

- **Setting**: 
  - **Desert Landscape**: Soft, undulating dunes create a backdrop, their curves highlighted by the moon’s gentle glow. The sand is depicted in muted, warm tones to reflect the vintage poster aesthetic.
  - **Night Sky**: A vast expanse of stars dotting the night sky, their glow reminiscent of diamond dust. The horizon is tinged with the last hints of twilight, in hues of crimson and gold.

- **Fireflies**: A cluster of fireflies dances in the air, their golden light painting delicate patterns, leading Amir and Zephyr towards the hidden oasis.

- **Oasis**:
  - **Water Reflection**: The small pool reflects the night sky, mirroring the stars and adding a mystical quality to the scene.
  - **Surrounding Palms**: Gentle palms sway slightly in the night breeze, framing the oasis and adding layers to the composition.

- **Ambient Details**: 
  - **Textures**: Use gentle textures to create a posterized effect on the dunes and sky, enhancing the illustration's vintage look.
  - **Lighting**: Bold outlines and posterized lighting highlight Amir and Zephyr, making them stand out against the serene desert backdrop.

- **Atmosphere**: The entire piece should evoke a sense of peace and tranquility, capturing the quiet beauty of the desert night and Amir’s deep connection to the world around him.

This artwork will visually convey the essence of the episode, inviting listeners into the tranquil embrace of Amir's desert dreamscape.
