Create a square (1:1 aspect ratio) digital illustration for a sleep podcast episode. The artwork should be directly inspired by the content of the generated story and episode description.

ESSENTIAL STORY ELEMENTS (MUST INCLUDE):
- The main character from the story must be prominently featured
- Their companion/animal friend must be clearly visible alongside them
- The setting and atmosphere from the story should frame the scene
- Character should be wearing either an APES ON KEYS hoodie OR an A-OK fitted cap

VISUAL STYLE (Based on reference artwork):
- Vintage poster/book cover aesthetic
- Bold, confident line work with clear outlines
- Muted, warm color palette (sunset oranges, deep blues, soft browns)
- Flat design with limited shading and posterized effects
- Retro illustration style reminiscent of mid-century children's books
- Emotionally serene and calming atmosphere
- Subtle grain or texture overlay for vintage feel

COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:
- Ensure all elements are well-contained within the frame
- Leave breathing room around the edges
- Balance negative space with illustrated elements
- Place main character and companion as the central focal points
- Position them centered in the image
- Focus on a single clear scene from the story
- Character (if present) wearing an APES ON KEYS hoodie OR an A-OK fitted cap

MOOD AND ATMOSPHERE:
- Peaceful and dreamlike quality
- Soft, twilight lighting
- Sense of quiet adventure or gentle wonder
- Evoke feelings of comfort and sleepiness
